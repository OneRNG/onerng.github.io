                <h3>Computers and Random Numbers</h3>

                <h4>Why do I need the OneRNG?</h4>
                <p>Random Numbers are essential for cryptography - for your privacy and security
                when communicating, when on the Internet.<p>
                <p>Computers are inherently predictable machines, and therefore terrible at "creating" high-quality
                Random Numbers. You need something from the "Real World", from the quantum world of physics, to obtain
                useful randomness, unpredictability, entropy.</p>
                <p>The OneRNG measures this quantum unpredictability in multiple ways, and presents the resulting data
                directly to your computer.</p>

                <h4>But why the OneRNG, and not these other "hardware random number generators" I can find?</h4>
                <p>Because Random Numbers are the very cornerstone of your privacy, you rely totally on
                your source of random data. As recent events have shown us, some immensely rich and powerful organisations
                have been working hard to undermine the security of every computer system on the planet, so that they
                can breach our privacy and spy on us all.</p>
                <p>You have to be <strong>sure</strong> that you can trust the foundations of your computer security.
                With the OneRNG, you don't have to trust anyone; you can <strong><em>verify</em></strong> that the device
                does what we promise &ellip; and what is more, you can <strong><em>verify</em></strong> that it does NOT
                do anything else; the OneRNG is not spying on you, or obeying some other master.</p>
