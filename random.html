<h3>Entropy and Random Numbers</h3>
<p>

I know the <span class='onerngbg'>OneRNG</span> is called a "Random Number Generator", but that isn't really what it does!
</p>

<p>
Good random numbers have a couple of main properties - they are <em>unpredictable</em> and
evenly <em>distributed</em> across their full range. Sometimes it can be difficult to determine the difference,
so here's a concrete example - look at the dice images at the top of this page. Every time the page loads, the
dice are different; effectively unpredictable. Except you can always predict with 100% accuracy the value of the final
die, once you know what the other 5 are ...
</p>

<p>
The reason for that is that the dice are simply in a randomised <em>order</em>; there are always 6 unique
values, from 1 to 6 inclusive. Distribution is perfectly even, and while the first die value is as unpredictable
as we can get it, the remaining ones are increasingly
predictable to the point of uselessness (in practice the whole
thing is driven by JavaScript's Math.random() function, which
isn't really all that random internally at all!  See the small
<a href="diceimg.js">source file</a> for details).
</p>

<p>
So you need to have both features to be useful. Let's see how the <span class='onerngbg'>OneRNG</span> helps
us make random numbers :-
</p>


<h4>The <span class='onerngbg'>OneRNG</span> generates Entropy</h4>
<p>

The <span class='onerngbg'>OneRNG</span> generates informational entropy by measuring internal RF noise sources,
specifically an avalanche diode circuit (the primary source), and a channel-hopping radio receiver (secondary source).
</p>

<p>
The noise from these systems is completely unpredictable, and we sample this noise
to produce a stream of data that can be loosely described as "random". However, this stream
of data will always be biased; for example there will tend to be more "1"s than "0"s.
</p>

<p>
In practice, the avalanche diode system picks up a slight DC bias, and generates about 5% more 1s
than 0s. The RF receiver tends to work better, with only about 0.14% more 1s; but it is potentially more
vulnerable to outside interference so we prefer to stick with the avalanche diode.
</p>

<p>
(If a noise source has failed, the <span class='onerngbg'>OneRNG</span> firmware will detect the resultant sequence of very biased data
(such as "all 0s") and refuse to use the source, effectively shutting down.)
</p>


<h4>A Whiter Shade of Pale</h4>
<p>

We can see that the data coming from the <span class='onerngbg'>OneRNG</span>'s primary source is fundamentally unpredictable, but isn't
perfectly evenly distributed. We can describe the quality of the primary source as delivering roughly
7 bits of entropy for every 8 bits of data.
</p>

<p>
This data needs to be improved before it can be used. This job is called "<em>whitening</em>", and the
technology generally used to do is is a "hash function". Hashes are intended to help compute data references
(rather than directly use the data themselves), and because they try hard to avoid "collision" (where two different
input data can produce the same output) and are generally not "invertable" (i.e. you cannot reasonably work backwards
from the output to discover what the input was), they turn out to be very good for smoothing out the distribution
of values in cases like ours.
</p>

<p>
We have a whitening hash function onboard the <span class='onerngbg'>OneRNG</span> (a CRC16 generator) that you can use, but it is not enabled
by default - we recommend that instead you just add the <span class='onerngbg'>OneRNG</span> as an entropy source to your existing Operating System's
random number generator.
</p>


<h4>OS Entropy Sources</h4>
<p>

The various different Operating Systems in use today collect their entropy from all the places that they believe
they can find real-world unpredictability. Computers are inherently completely predictable in their operation - if you
can describe the current condition of the machine, you know what state it will go to next, perfectly. Of course they
are increasingly complex, which makes this job impossible in practice!
</p>

<p>
Linux collects timing data from the keyboard and mouse usage, and from the IDE disks. You can also elect to
collect data from any specialist RNG hardware on your system, such as the Intel RdRand CPU instruction or a Trusted
Platform Module. Many systems today, especially servers, don't have keyboards, mice, or even IDE disks; and many 
people elect to distrust vendor hardware systems for highly sensitive tasks (although see
<a href="trust.html">"On Trust"</a>).
</p>


<h4>OS Random Number Sources</h4>
<p>

Sticking with the example of Linux, /dev/random provides random numbers by directly hashing the internal entropy pool.
Each use of /dev/random depletes the data available, and if the entropy sources cannot deliver sufficient data, your
request to read /dev/random will block - it will wait until more entropy is available.<p>
</p>

<p>
For almost every normal task, you are supposed to instead use /dev/urandom. This interface internally does exactly
the same as /dev/random, except that when the entropy pool is close to exhaustion it will instead start to deliver data
from a software device, a PRNG that has been seeded from 'good' random data.
</p>

<p>
If you use the <span class='onerngbg'>OneRNG</span> to populate Linux's entropy pool data directly, both systems are "improved" - high-quality reads
from /dev/random will not block (unless you are exceptionally greedy), and /dev/urandom will not need to fall back
to PRNGs.
