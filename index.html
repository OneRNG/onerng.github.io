                <p>The OneRNG is a project to create a reliable and open hardware random number generator - one that can be verified by the user, one that can be trusted.</p>

                <h4>Why do I need the OneRNG?</h4>
                <p>You rely on a high-quality source of random numbers to maintain your privacy and security in computer
                communication; but computers have too few sources of truly random data for the demands we place upon them.
                Increasingly we have been distrusting the solutions given to us by others, as they are shown to be weak in
                so many ways - because of faults in implementation, in design, or due to subversion by attackers who simply
                do not care about the consequences of their actions (I'm looking at you, NSA).<!-- There's more discussion of
                <a href="random.html">computers and random numbers</a> here, too. -->
                </p>

                <p>The OneRNG is an Open Hardware, Open Source, simple and <strong><em>verifiable</em></strong> source of entropy;
                we do not ask you to "trust" us, we give you the ability to verify for yourself that the OneRNG does
                what we claim, and that it does nothing else.
                </p>

                <h4>Verifiable?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The OneRNG is Open Hardware - you can get the full hardware schematics, you can build your own. You can
                see the full details of every component that has been used.
                    </p></li>

                    <li><p>The OneRNG is Open Source Software - you can see how the firmware is written, you can modify it and use
                your own version if you prefer.
                    </p></li>

                    <li><p>The OneRNG is <em>verifiable</em> - you can prove that it does exactly what you expect, and nothing else.
                    You can ask it to dump the current firmware to you, you can see all the components on the board.
                    </p></li>

                    <li><p>The OneRNG is reliable - if it detects instability in the entropy generators, it will stop delivering
                    data and blink the status LEDs.
                    </p></li>
                </ul>

                <h3><img src="img/icon_5909/icon_5909.svg" width="24"/> Current State</h3>
                <p>We have a small number of beta units that have been assembled and programmed by Paul in his own lab,
                and these have been sent out to a few testers for comment.
                <p>The current beta unit is described in detail over at the
                <a href="http://moonbaseotago.com/onerng/">Moonbase Otago</a> site.
                Here's a photo of it :-<br/>

                <h3><img src="img/icon_21425/icon_21425.svg" width="24" /> Discussions</h3>
                <p>Join the <a href="http://lists.onerng.info/groups/onerng-talk/">OneRNG Talk</a> discussion (sponsored by <a href="http://OnlineGroups.net/">OnlineGroups.net</a>, thanks!)</p>
                <p>Tell us about other approaches to solving these problems, about how we would address your specific use-cases,
                what features you would like us to consider for future units. If you have built your own unit (whether the OneRNG
                or any other style of HWRNG) let us know too.</p>
