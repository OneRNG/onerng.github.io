                <h2>Hardware Random Number Generator</h2>
                <p>The OneRNG is a project to create a reliable and open hardware random number generator - one that can be verified by the user, one that can be trusted.</p>
                <hr/>
                <p>At this early stage, the team is small, the hardware is in very early prototype and the software is basically absent.
                But we have some good ideas about how to provide a HWRNG that you can verify and trust.</p>
                <p>Over the next few weeks we'll start describing the project in more detail. There will be an email list/forum for talk, hardware designs and software source.</p>
