<h4>What is the [%- onerng -%]?</h4>

[% FILTER html_para -%]
The [% onerng %] is an Open Hardware, Open Source, simple and <strong><em>verifiable</em></strong>
USB-connected source of entropy;
we do not ask you to "trust" us, we give you the ability to verify for yourself that the [% onerng %] does
what we claim, and that it does nothing else.

We are currently running a
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbaseotago/onerng-an-open-source-entropy-generator" />campaign on Kickstarter</a>
to fund construction
of [% onerng %].

Please head over there and help to secure the future of this design!

<h3><hr/></h3>
[% onerng %] collects entropy from an avalanche diode circuit, and from a channel-hopping RF receiver.
It even has a &ldquo;tinfoil hat&rdquo; to prevent RF interference &mdash;
you can remove the hat in order to visually verify the components being used.


You rely on a high-quality source of random numbers to maintain your privacy and security in computer
communication; but computers have too few sources of truly random data for the demands we place upon them.
Increasingly we have been distrusting the solutions given to us by others, as they are shown to be weak in
so many ways - because of faults in implementation, in design, or due to subversion by attackers who simply
do not care about the consequences of their actions (I'm looking at you, NSA).

In general usage, we recommend that you use the [% onerng %] as an entropy source for your operating system's
own RNG software; this allows you to consume extremely large quantities of random data without either blocking
or reducing the quality of the data.

<h4>Verifiable?</h4>
<div>
<ul>
    <li>The [% onerng %] is Open Hardware - you can get the full hardware schematics, you can build your own. You can
    see the full details of every component that has been used.
    You can visually check every component on the boards that we supply.
    </li>

    <li>The [% onerng %] is Open Source Software - you can see how the firmware is written, you can modify it and use
    your own version if you prefer (although you'll need a separate programmer unit, also Open Hardware of course)
    </li>

    <li>The [% onerng %] is <em>verifiable</em> - you can prove that it does exactly what you expect, and nothing else.
    You can ask it to dump the current firmware to you, you can see all the components on the board.
    </li>

    <li>The [% onerng %] is fail-safe reliable - if it detects instability in the entropy generators, it will stop delivering
    data and blink the status LEDs.
    </li>

    <li>The [% onerng %] is safe to attach to your systems. Because you can only modify the firmware over a dedicated
    connection on the board, it cannot be subverted over USB, and it will not
    <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/when-good-usb-devices-go-bad/d/d-id/1297876">attack you</a> over USB.

<h3><img src="img/icon_5909/icon_5909.svg" width="24"/> Current State</h3>
[% FILTER html_para %]
Fundraising on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbaseotago/onerng-an-open-source-entropy-generator" />Kickstarter</a> has started, and is progressing strongly.

The more we fund, the more we can build &mdash; and the more ideas we get
the better the [% onerng %] can get.

Join the <a href="http://lists.onerng.info/groups/onerng-talk/">[% onerng %] Talk</a> discussion
(sponsored by <a href="http://OnlineGroups.net/">OnlineGroups.net</a>, thanks!)

Tell us about other approaches to solving these problems, about how we would address your specific use-cases,
what features you would like us to consider for future units.
If you have built your own unit (whether the [% onerng %]
or any other style of HWRNG) let us know too.

<h4>External Reviews, Presentations and Discussions</h4>
[% FILTER html_para %]
Let us know about other places where [% onerng %] has been discussed,
and we'll list them here. Even the bad ones! We will of course point
out technical inaccuracies, but there's no point in trying to suppress
information from the Internet ...
